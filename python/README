This directory contains python tools that assist in the forensic analysis.
Contains:
- extract.py: extract MAC addresses from memory dumps
- receive.py: a tool to receive files from cURL. Doesn't work for memory dumps though.

## Sadly this doesn't seem to work. Breaks after transfering about 40M:

curl -F file=@/dev/mem http://145.100.102.62:3301/

## Instead, get the cross-compiled netcat binary and try as follows:

<server> netcat -l 0.0.0.0 3301 | dd of=mem.`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`
<miracast> dd if=/dev/mem | ./netcat 192.168.203.66 3301
